# Datascience Cookiecutter Starter

## Usage

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter gh:maximz/datascience-cookiecutter-starter
```

## Features

TODO

## Development

```bash
pre-commit install
make lint
```

For long blocks with templated braces that shouldn't involve Cookiecutter -- e.g. the inner CI yaml -- wrap with `{% raw -%}` and `{%- endraw %}`.
